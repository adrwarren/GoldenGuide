  <h1>Almost Half-Way There</h1>
  <h3>This year is a great chance to prove yourself to colleges!</h3>
	<p> If you haven't already done so, this is the year start narrowing down your interests. If you're looking to go to college, pick extracurriculars and stick with them. Colleges want to see your passion and tenacity. It's ok if you don't know what you want to do yet, but don't just pick something because it will look good on a college resume. The last thing you want to experience in high school is burnout. Pick fun activities, like your favorite sport, visual arts, or maybe your journalism club. Whatever you do, don't overload yourself! This is a time to have fun and figure out what you want to do.</p>

<h3> I know this sounds early, but... </h3>
<p>	Guess what? It's time to start studying for the SAT! If you can, visit your local or school library to find SAT and AP prep books. This is a cheaper alternative to the $50+ you and your parents will probably spend on new books. You can also check out Half Priced Books or Thriftbooks for good deals.</p>
<p> Now is also a good time to start looking for scholarships! There are huge scholarships that you can apply for online, but be sure to check for local ones, too. Merit based scholarships, athletic scholarships, community service scholarships, and so many more take pressure off paying for college. You should start applying to these scholarships as soon as possible!</p>
<h3> Begin the college search. </h3>
<p> Start looking for colleges that offer subjects that you want to take. Make a spreadsheet of these colleges, and add vital information about them to it. </p>
<h3>If you get stuck...</h3>
<p> These days, it's easy for high schoolers to experience burnout. If you're being unnecessarily stresed out, it's ok to reach out to someone. Your school counselors can help you, but only if you let them. You can also find study groups, subject tutors, and others that will encourage you to succeed.</p>
<h3> Summers are for the beach, right? </h3>
<p> Once you're done with your sophomore year, you're officially halfway done with high school! While there's a lot to look forward too, there's also a lot to do. This summer, keep studying for the SAT. (and AP tests if you want to take them) You're going to be a lot busier next year, so take some time off and relax. You deserve it. You do. You got this.  </p>
