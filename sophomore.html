  <h1>Almost Half-Way There</h1>
  <h3>This year is a great chance to prove yourself to colleges!</h3>
	<p> If you haven't already done so, this is the year start narrowing down your interests. If you're looking to go to college, pick extracurriculars that you're going to stick with. Colleges want to see your passion and tenacity. It's ok if you don't know what you want to do yet, but don't just pick something because it will look good on a college resume. The last thing you want to experience in high school is burnout. Pick fun activities, like your favorite sport, visual arts, or maybe your journalism club. Whatever you do, don't overload yourself! This is a time to have fun and figure out what you want to do.</p>

<h3> I know this sounds early, but... </h3>
<p>	Guess what? It's time to start studying for the SAT! If you can, visit your local or school library to find SAT and AP prep books. This is a cheaper alternative to the $50+ you and your parents will probably spend on Amazon.You can also check out Half Priced Books or Thriftbooks for good deals.</p>
<p> Now is also a good time to start looking for scholarships! There are a lot of scholarships, so be sure to check for local ones too! There are also huge scholarships that you can apply for online. There are merit based scholarships, athletic scholarships, community service scholarships, and so many more that take pressure off paying for college. You should start applying to these scholarships as soon as possible!</p>
<h3> Begin the college search. </h3>
<p> Start looking for colleges that offer subjects that you want to take. Make a spreadsheet of these colleges, where you can add vital information about them. </p>
<h3>If you get stuck...</h3>
<p> These days, it's easy for high schoolers to experience burnout. If you're being unnecessarily stresed out, it's ok to reach out to someone. Your school counselors can help you as long as you let them. You may also find study groups, subject tutors, and others that want to see you succeed.</p>
<h3> Summers are for the beach, right? </h3>
<p> Once you're done with your sophomore year, you're officially halfway done with high school! While there's a lot to look forward too, there's also a lot to do. This summer, keep studying for the SAT. (and AP tests if you want to take them) You're going to be a lot busier next year, so take some time off and relax. You deserve it. You do. You got this.  </p>
