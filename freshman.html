  <h2> Summer Activities </h2>
  <h4> Extracurricular Activities </h4>
  <p> There's no specific extracurriculars that will look "extravagant" or "special" for college application, rather you should do extracurriculars you are truly passionate about! It's also about quality over quantitiy. The amount of time you spend every week for that extracurricular, the impacts you make, and the initiative actions you parttake are what matter when college application are considering. College is far away but keep in mind about your passion! </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Volunteering: Give back to the community by volunteering at your local library, tutoring students, cleaning the park/beach, etc. Get those service hours in! </li><br>
    <li>

    <li> Visual Arts: You can start learning how to play an instrument, create an art masterpiece, sell jewelry of your own, take photos, or anything where you are able release your inner creativity! </li> <br>
    <li> STEM: Do fun science experiments or create your own research project! Maybe there's something that hasn't been discovered yet? Start learning how to code or how to start your own buisness. </li><br>
  
  <h4> Classes/Courses </h4>
  <p> Taking classes that will count towards high school graduation or even the A-G requirement will help you save up time and space to do other things you are more passionate about. Not only that, taking a college or high school level course will help you prepare on how rigorous your classes will be. </p>
