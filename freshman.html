Should I take high school classes during the summer? What is the A-G requirement? What about my friends? Don't worry! On this page, you'll be able to find the answer to all of your questions. We ensure you that our tips and advices will help you navigate your freshmen year with little confusion. Though many of your friends will be heading off to different high schools, worry not! You'll make new friends and in no time, see yourself eating lunch with people you might not even know! </p>

  <h4> Remarks from an Experienced High School Student </h4>
  <ol>
    <li> Use your time wisely. </li>
    <li> Participate in activities, clubs, classes, etc., that you are genuinely passionate about. </li>
    <li> Create strong connections with teachers as they can be great resources. </li>
    <li> Don't sleep too late and get in the habit of drinking caffeine. </li>
    <li> Take the opportunities in front of you. </li>
  </ol>

  <h2> Summer Activities </h2>
  <h4> Extracurricular Activities </h4>
  <p> There's no specific extracurriculars that will look "extravagant" or "special" for college applications, rather, you should do extracurriculars you are truly passionate about! It's also about quality over quantitiy. The amount of time you spend every week for that extracurricular, the impacts you make, and the initiative actions you parttake are what matter when colleges are considering you. College is far away, but keep in mind the things you're passionate about! </p>

  <ul>
    <li> <b>Volunteering:</b> Give back to the community by volunteering at your local library, tutoring students, cleaning the park/beach, etc. Get those service hours in! </li><br>
    <li>
      <b>Sports:</b> Oftentimes, high schools offer free sports summer camp, so take that opportunitiy. Be sure to be mentally and physically healthy! You can train for the incoming fall season, which is when you can try out for specific sport teams. </li><br>
    <li> <b>Visual Arts:</b> You can start learning how to play an instrument, create an art masterpiece, sell jewelry of your own, take photos, or anything where you are able release your inner creativity! </li> <br>
    <li><b> STEM:</b> Do fun science experiments or create your own research project! Maybe there's something that hasn't been discovered yet? Or, you can start learning how to code or how to start your own buisness. </li><br></ul>
  
  <h4> Classes/Courses </h4>
  <p> Taking classes that will count towards high school graduation or even the A-G requirement will help you save up time and space to do other things you are more passionate about. Not only that, taking a college or high school level course will help you prepare on how rigorous your classes will be. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Your High School Website:</b> There are great resources for you to explore whether it be college/career readiness, summer assignments,scholarships etc. </li><br>
    <li><b> Dual Enrollments:</b> If your high school offers community college classes that can count towards high school AND college credits, I highly recommend taking them. This will give you a head start in saving money in college and time in school. </li><br>
    <li><b><a href="https://www.coursera.org/"> Coursera: </a></b> Coursera provides a plethora of self-paced online college courses which will allow you to not only gain new skills and knowledge, but also certificates you can use to put on applications (the courses are free, but you must pay for the certificate)! It's a great opportunity to learn something outside of school or improve on your capabilities. </li></ul>

    <h2> School Tips </h2>
    <p> During the school year, you will encounter drama, fights, stress, procrastination, and negative aspects you hope to avoid. </p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Time management:</b> Use your time wisely. Prioritize what is most important, and think about how procrastinating will affect your future. Remove any distractions and focus on the topic in front of you. </li><br>
    <li> <b>Initiative:</b> Take the amazing opportunities in front of you! Don't believe that your age should be the barrier in you in reaching your potential. </li><br>
    <li><b> Build Connections:</b> Develop a friendly connection with your teachers and peers. No one wants is drama and fights. </li><br>
    <li><b> Have Fun:</b> Enjoy your freshmen year as much as possible. Time goes by fast and the school events you miss are the events you aren't able to experience. </li>
