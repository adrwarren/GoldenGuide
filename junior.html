    <h1>You've Made It...You're Officially an Upperclassman</h1>
    <h3>Now what?</h3>
    <div class = "msg"><p>You've probably heard that junior year can be the most difficult year in high school. Good thing we're here! Trust me, it really isn't as bad as it seems. We've got some resources and advice that will really help you throughout the school year. Personally, I think my sophmore year was more draining than my junior year. That being said, I'm here so you don't make the mistakes I made my junior year! Number one tip: Get enough sleep and don't procrastinate. Easier said than done, I know all too well. Still, here's some things I wish someone had told me my junior year.</p></div>
    <h3>A Letter to My Junior Self</h3>
    <div class = "letter"><p>Dear Junior Me,</p>
      <p>How are you? You're really dreading this year, huh? Don't worry, it won't be as bad as the last year. Listen, I know all those classes seem scary. Still, it's nothing you can't handle. It really isn't. Now that the motivational part is over: drop AP Calc AB. Drop it. Drop it, drop it, drop it. You really need the best possible GPA, so you really need to drop it (siiiiigh, I really wish I had recieved this letter). But even if you decide not to drop it, know that you'll still be fine in the long run. You even do great on the AP exam! Listen, this year is hard work, but its not any more difficult than what you're used to. So please, PLEASE stop procrastinating. Set timers for your phone, turn it off, chuck it into the nearest river, I don't care. You know that when you procrastinate, you end up staying up late and then you get sick. Then, you fall asleep in class, don't take good notes, and have to teach yourself the material. It's no fun, I tell you. But, speaking of fun, join some more clubs! Even though you're a junior, it's not too late to become a part of your community, your doubt is baseless. And make sure you're involved, too. Go to the meetings, and all the extra stuff. It's fun, it really is. You're going to regret not going to those pep bands, saying you'll do it senior year. And sports! Keep working out, or your winter season is going to be embarassing (ugh). Also, start working on your FBLA project, dude. Like I said, stop procrastinating. Or you're gonna end up dropping out. Yes, that was embarassing, too. Even so, junior year was still super fun. Make sure you spend time with your friends, even study dates with them are great. Honestly, you're way more productive during these times. Make friends with the teachers, and don't be afraid to speak up and ask questions, or talk to them during office hours. Many of them will help you, and some may even give you recommendations for college! Yes, you need to start planning for college. Take the SAT and ACT, early in the year. And actually study for it, for real. Start researching colleges and taking tours. You may think its still a little early, but it's really not. Do it. In the beginning of your junior year. Make a spreadsheet of all the colleges you want to apply to, with information on their application proccesses. And, start applying to scholarships, too. College isn't free. Find a job, too. I know it's a little difficult, but make an attempt to find somewhere close to home you can bike to. Even just by spending and hour every other day on college and scholarship related opportunities, you're going to feel much more prepared for the future. I know being a junior freaks you out a bit, and I know you're thinking that your high school career is practically halfway over and therefore almost done, but that's nothing to be sad about, really. You know you're looking foward to college, keep looking ahead. Don't worry, you got it!</p></div>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Senior Year Me</p>
